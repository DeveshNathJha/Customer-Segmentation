# Customer-Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It is part of my internship work at Celebal Technologies.

##  Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy that helps businesses target their audience more effectively. In this project, I:

- Explored customer data through visualization
- Preprocessed and normalized the dataset
- Applied K-Means Clustering to find customer segments
- Analyzed the resulting clusters to gain business insights

##  Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- **Features**:
  - `CustomerID`
  - `Gender`
  - `Age`
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1–100)`

>  Additional feature engineering included income-to-age ratios and gender encoding.
